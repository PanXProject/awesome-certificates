# Awesome Certificates Manifesto

- Most certifications require payment, making them inaccessible to many people.

- There are some free online courses provided, but very few of them offer certificates for free.

- This project aims to provide a curated list of free IT, Computer Science, and Business certifications across various sub-fields and levels of experience.

- If you want to contribute to [awesome-certificates](awesome-certificates.md), start with this [guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

- If you want to add a course/certificate to this list, open a [pull request](pull_request_template.md).
